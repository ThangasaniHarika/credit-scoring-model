Introduction

In the modern financial landscape, credit scoring plays a crucial role in determining an individual’s creditworthiness. Traditionally, credit scores have been calculated using statistical models such as logistic regression, relying on fixed rules and limited variables. However, with the rise of machine learning (ML), more accurate and dynamic credit scoring systems have emerged.
credit score model using machine learning leverages historical credit data to learn patterns and predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. By analyzing a wide range of features — including payment history, outstanding debt, employment status, and even alternative data sources — ML models can uncover complex relationships and improve predictive performance.
Popular ML algorithms used for credit scoring include decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, and neural networks. These models not only enhance accuracy but can also adapt over time as new data becomes available.
